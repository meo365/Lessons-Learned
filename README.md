# Lessons-Learned
Repo for storing finished projects and documenting any lessons

I chose to use the last project for this journal for three reasons.

1. It went really well from planning to implementation
2. The in-code documentation with comments is well done, so it will be easy to understand later on what each section will do.
3. I didn't start to code this at midnight like the other ones, and it is visible in the code quality as I am not sleep-deprived.

# Improvements
The code could be enhanced with better formatting to improve visual appeal. It could also implement a GUI via OpenGL with or without Dear ImGui for a better user interface.

# Challenges
The hardest part of this course was definitely project two. Due to sleep deprivation, I for some reason wanted to switch everything to class/header files, and it went from working to borked, and I just kept going. That one was a real mess. Another challenge was that the provided remote computer would not run executables in VS Studio, requiring me to migrate to CodeBlocks on my own computer, which actually helped streamline development because CodeBlocks is pretty good.

# Transferable skills
The most transferable skill I would like to work on would be linked lists. I can understand the benefit of using pointers and linked lists for object tracking, and the usage in the later modules was neat. It is a pain to track, but when it works, it is just like how I used to use a dictionary of dictionaries to track similar objects. 

# This program specifically
The best way I made this program maintainable was with constant comments explaining each line or function. Much of what I used was copying into similar sections and altering them for each specific purpose. It also helped that I followed a standard to separate the function declarations and definitions, which can allow an easier separation into header files to clean up the main.cpp file. You can see the variables at the top, functions at the top, and the main is a simple loop.

# Other
I did not reference the class or specifics to avoid others from easily searching this repo. After the course, it will be private to avoid any issues later.
